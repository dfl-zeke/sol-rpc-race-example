# Solana RPC Websocket test

This test runs 500 test on devnet and 500 test on mainnet
You have to export secret key from Phantom (I did not find that on sollet) and have lil USDC on account. ON MAINNET, TEST COSTS GAS FEE * 500

Just run `yarn` or `npm install`

After installation, you can run script with `yarn start` or `npm run start`
